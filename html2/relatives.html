                    <p>Homemaker and full-time strict mom of the Simpson family. Marge is the moralistic force in her
                        family
                        and often provides a grounding voice in the midst of her family's antics by trying to maintain
                        order
                        in the Simpson household. Aside from her duties at home, Marge has flirted briefly with a number
                        of
                        careers ranging from police officer to anti-violence activist. </p>

                        Marge
                        Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie.</p>
                    <p>Even at a young age, Bart has accomplished many feats. He has won an award for his Angry Dad web
                        series, he has discovered a new comet which was named after himself, and he also has performed
                        in a
                        successful band with Milhouse Van Houten, Nelson Muntz and Ralph Wiggum.</p>

                    <p>A charismatic 8-year-old girl, who exceeds the standard achievement of intelligence level of
                        children
                        her age. Not to everyone's surprise, she is also the moral center of her family. In her
                        upbringing,
                        Lisa lacks parental involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to hobbies such as playing
                        saxophone
                        and guitar, riding and caring for horses, and interest in advanced studies. In school, Lisa's
                        popularity is affected by those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with only
                        a
                        few friends. She focuses on her goals and strives to reach her potential, and at the age of
                        eight,
                        she is already a member of Mensa with an IQ of 159.</p>

                        is often seen sucking on her pacifier, and, when she walks, she trips over her clothing and
                        falls on her face. Because she rarely ever talks, Maggie is the least seen and heard in the
                        Simpson family.</p>

                        Homer, when Homer was 9 years old so she could protect them from danger. Another reason she left
                        was because she could not stand her husband's intolerance.</p>
