            <h2>Краткая биография</h2>
            <p>Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12, 1956)[11] is the protagonist of the show and the spouse of Marge Simpson
                and father of Bart Simpson, Lisa Simpson, and Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be around 240
                lbs), lazy, and often ignorant to the world around him. Although Homer has many flaws, he has shown to
                have great caring, love, and even bravery to those he cares about.</p>
            <p>Homer works as a low level safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in Sector 7G, although
                he is often incompetent and negligent towards his duty. He spends a great deal of his time at Moe's
                Tavern with his lifelong friends Barney, Carl, Lenny, and the bartender Moe. At his home, he can often
                be found sitting on the couch mindlessly watching TV while snacking on food and drinking Duff. Homer is
                also the only son of Abe and Mona. When Homer gets provoked, he strangles Bart for pressuring him. Even
                though he hates Patty and Selma, he played as Selma’s husband in order for her to adopt Ling. As a
                result of this, Homer is the legal adoptive father of Ling Bouvier.</p>
            <p>Homer may just be a normal man, but he has had many great achievements and experiences in his life. He
                has won a Grammy, an Academy Award, a Pulitzer Prize, been to space, and has saved Springfield many
                times.</p>
            <p>Homer is a pure moron who can go back and forth from being downright horrible to an extremely caring and
                loving man. Homer's personality is one of frequent immaturity, frequent stupidity, dim witness,
                selfishness, laziness, and explosive anger; one might say it is that of the "Average Joe". He also
                suffers from a short attention span which complements his intense but short-lived passion for hobbies,
                enterprises and various causes. Despite his family flaws, he is a loving father and husband, even if he
                can be ignorant or oblivious to families feelings and ideas. When he thinks he has let anyone he loves
                down, it really does effect him, and in the end, will do anything for them. Another contribute to his
                "Working Joe" persona was that he has also shown to be sensitive about his masculinity; being initially
                upset over Marge becoming a police officer as he though it made her "the man of the house", as well as
                refusing to call a contractor when Marge wanted her kitchen remodeled as to not emasculate his
                pride.</p>
            <p>Homer is prone to emotional outbursts; he gets very envious of his neighbors, the Flanders family, and is
                easily enraged at his son, Bart, and strangles the boy in an exaggerated manner. His trademark phrase to
                strangling Bart, "Why you little...!" and on one occasion, "Why you little bastard!". He also spanks
                Bart sometimes and, in one case, Lisa. One time, he was too busy to spank them, so he told them to go to
                their rooms and spank themselves. He does not show compunction about this, and is not attempting to hide
                his actions from people outside the family, even showing disregard for his son's well being in other
                ways, such as leaving Bart alone at a port, or allowing Bart to go court for skateboarding naked on
                his dare when all he would have to do is attend a one hour parenting class signifying not only his
                disregard for Bart but his extreme laziness.</p>
